# OmniFocus scripts

This is my little dump of OmniFocus scripts that I use in my workflow. Most of them are meant to get
executed through something like KeyboardMaestro.

## prioritize-through-estimation.js

This script abuses the `Estimation` field of OmniFocus to hack a pseudo-prioritization into place.

## push-to-7pm.applescript

Applescript to, well, push all selected tasks to 7pm on the same day. I am using this very actively
to have only one _Next_ perspective and move everything that I have to do at home to after work ends
(=7pm).

Just change the time in the last function to push the tasks to some other time.
